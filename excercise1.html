        My name is <strong>John Doe</strong>, and I have always been passionate about technology and 
        <em>innovation</em>. I was born and raised in a small town where I developed a love for computers 
        at a young age. Throughout my academic journey, I have taken various courses that deepened my 
        understanding of <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, Java, and R. 
        In my spare time, I enjoy working out, hanging out with friends, playing video games, 
        and doing photography as my hobby.

        I am currently 21 years old, but I will turn 22 on October 21<sup>st</sup> of this year.
        Appalachain was the school I chose because it was close to home and I heard that the CS department
        was one of the best of the area schools I was looking to attend. This is my 2nd year at App State as I 
        transfered in for Western Piedmont Community College. While at WPCC, I double majored with an Associate in Arts, 
        and an Associate in Science degree. I really enjoyed my time as it allowed me to grow close with my Community
        and reach out and be more involved as well.

        During my time in Community College. I picked up an interest in Photography as a hobby on the side. I also used
        This passion to start my very own media outlet. Since 2021, this media outlet has grown to over 7,200 followers,
        and high been one of the go to places for sports in the western region of North Carolina. I used my passion in photography
        as well as web knowledge to create something that I never imagined that would become as popular as it has.

    The chemical formula for water is H<sub>2</sub>O, and <s>strikethrough</s> text is used to indicate something 
    that is no longer valid. The next generation of coding languages will be even more powerful, and I'm excited 
    to be part of that future.
